- webhooks - from clerk authentication to ngrok
    - ngrok serves as a communicator between localhost and the web, svik is to make sure it's valid and not malicious data being send in
    - context:
        - clerk stores user information upon sign in, need a way to get those data
    - upon new user created, clerk webhook gets trigger
    - this sends information to ngrok's custom domain
    - lsof -i :8080 to see what is using 8080
    - kill -9 71014 to kill id using 8080
    - use webhook BEFORE express.json() and urlencoded
